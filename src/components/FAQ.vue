    <div class="md-headline">FAQ</div>
    <div class="title">I don't drink any alcohol, can I just get a water?</div>
    <p>Absolutely! Down the hall, through the bedroom, there's a door leading to the terrace. Here you will find a little faucet at knee-height. Feel free to take as much as you'd like. Unfortunately, the usage of glasses is reserved by the management for alcoholic beverages.</p>

    <div class="title">I can't see any pending orders anymore! That spinner-thing just keeps going.</div>
    <p>A known problem *cough*backend*cough*. Often it will re-appear after ordering something. If not, come find me and order manually.</p>

    <p>The toilet is in the bathroom.</p>

    <div class="title">Ok great, where is the bathroom?</div>
    <p>Down the hallway second door on the left. If you see a staircase, you went right. If you see a bed, you went straight. If you see a washing machine you took the first door.</p>

    <p>Not particulary</p>

    <div class="title">Can I go look around to satisfy my curiosity?</div>
    <p>Knock yourself out! Opening of certain cabinets is entirely on your own risk: management is not responsible for traumatizing visuals.</p>

    <div class="title">I would do X or Y different in this app.</div>
    <p>Behold! The field in which I grow my fucks. Lay thine eyes upon it and thou shalt see that it is barren.</p>
